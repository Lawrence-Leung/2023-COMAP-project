# Exploring of Diverse Plant Communities and Adaptation to Drought Conditions Based on Advanced Logistics Model with Variable Growth

## üå± Project Introduction

Welcome to our project repository! This project is our entry into the **American College Student Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) hosted by COMAP in February 2023**. Our research was subsequently presented at the **Engineering Index conference: 2023 3rd International Conference on Biomedical and Bioinformatics Engineering**.

This study aims to accurately depict the symbiotic relationship between plants in the plant community and the symbiosis, competition and symbiosis as precipitation changes by proposing an advanced Logistic model that adjusts to changes in precipitation and introduces environmental capacity parameters that change with the level of symbiosis. Interactions between independent growth.

## üìù Summary

In this study, we explored common biological mutualisms in nature, such as soybeans providing food for rhizobia, which use atmospheric nitrogen to synthesize nitrogen for soybeans to absorb. We propose an advanced logistic model that adapts to changes in precipitation and changing environmental capacity with symbiosis levels. The purpose of the study was to accurately describe the symbiotic relationships of various populations in plant communities and the interactions between symbiosis, competition, and independent growth as precipitation changes, by using finite difference methods and third-order Hermitian interpolation methods. Our model provides a comprehensive understanding of interactions between plant populations, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of plant growth and development.

The study found that a combination of woody and herbaceous plants had the highest growth rates and total biomass, while only herbaceous plants took longer (seven times) longer to reach environmental capacity. This study also revealed that irregular weather patterns, different levels of species biomass have different effects on the recovery time of plant communities after drought or damage, that different types of pollution have different effects on community regeneration, and that overgrazing Minimal impact.

## üõ†Ô∏è Repository content

This repository contains the following content:

- Complete entry paper (written in English): Detailed description of our research methods, data analysis, model construction and results.
- Source code: including complete code for data processing, model training and prediction.
- Dataset: The dataset used to train and test the model.

Notice:
- The size of a single file of some source codes exceeds 25MB, so we package all single files exceeding 25MB in the corresponding directory into `OVERSIZED_DATA.zip` and its sub-volumes. The compressed package needs to be decompressed to **the same directory** as the compressed package. can be used normally.
